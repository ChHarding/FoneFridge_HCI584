UNTIL JUNE 14 VERSION SUMMARY

By far I tried to work on pandas but pandas module didn't work. (after several hours another module I tried to install did't work either.)
After that failure I started creating the GUI in TkInter. (It was fun!)
I created 2 windows, one for manual entry and the other one for popular item library search. (ALL IN main.ipynb)
I put dropdown menu in the manual entry window for the food item types and measurement unit.
I tried to add calendar and followed along videos on how to install tkcalendar but failed. I will search for it further this week. I'll ask it in piazza as well.
I also created the DB for the popular items library as a .csv file (in csv_files folder). There are some images for reference.
I put out the types in the block_organization.drawio file.
